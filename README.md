# Introduction

React Home Picker is a spin-off of a project I created for a technical assessment.

---

# Objectives

- Allow users to pick a home and view compatible lots and vice versa
- Save homes/lots in Redux
- Allow user login (WIP)

---

# Optimizations 

  These are some of the optimizations I am in the midst of implementing into my project given the time.
  
- User Login / Authentication with Passport.js
- Better styling / cleaner layout on the cards
- General responsiveness / CSS improvements
- Global data store in Redux rather than fetching data from API

---

# Tech used 

JavaScript, React, Redux, CSS

Eventually Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Passport

---

# Packages/Dependencies used 

react, react-router-dom, react-redux, @reduxjs/toolkit

---

# Install all the dependencies or node packages used for development via Terminal

`npm install`
